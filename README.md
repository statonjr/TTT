# TTT

A simple tic-tac-toe game that I wrote at JFK airport after getting asked about building one in an interview. Now with scoring!

This game is built with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. Tested in WebKit and Chrome.

Thanks to my son, Alexander, for helping me find bugs.

## TODO

Add node.js support.
